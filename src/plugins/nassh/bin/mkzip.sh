# The CWS limits each dotted field to 16bits (65535), and allows only 4 fields.

# If we're creative, we can pack these so the version is always increasing.
#
# We're really just worried about two consecutive builds not decreasing.
# Keep in mind that we hand maintain the first two components of the version in
# the manifest.json.
